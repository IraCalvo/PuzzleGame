# PuzzleGame

Hello! My name is Ira Calvo, and this game is merely just an amalgamation of what I have learned so far within game design.
I dropped out of college to pursue Video Gamde design full time in summer, and gotten my parents permision to do this in fall.
To challenge myself I decided to make a game completely from scratch using only what I know from the classes I've taken so far sort of like a proof of concept.
This project took about 2 weeks to make, as again I made it from scratch and did not search anything up on google to make the base game. 
Within this project I gained a MASSIVE apprection for puzzle makers, I learned that making a puzzle from scratch is not easy. 
I learned the necessary skills to actually make the code for the puzzle as well as actually making the puzzle.

what this project features:
Player animation
Classic puzzles inspired by The Legend of Zelda
Saving variables across scenes
Collision detection
Interaction system
Tilemaping
